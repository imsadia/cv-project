# Instance Segmentation

To run the project, please run following commands:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/imsadia/cv-project
cd cv-project
python setup.py install
```

You need to download and keep mask_rcnn_coco.h5 file inside root directory for using pre-trained coco weights. Further you need to download 
[CoNSeP](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LLlKd2tw__J4regVfiVWYGsjawZ_bGfP?usp=sharing) and 
[CPM17](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l55cv3DuY-f7-JotDN7N5nbNnjbLWchK) datasets. Keep both datasets 
inside dataset folder created in the root directory.

The link to the github repository from where I have picked up mrcnn for using mask rcnn model is [matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
